Overview
-------------
This project aimed to use 3D Kinematics principles to get a robot to plan and lay out custom domino paths. Foam bricks were used as the dominoes, and we wanted the robot to collaborate with you to decide upon a path, leaving the fun of knocking over the path to you. 

We had a choice of two robots: the Baxter robot and the Panda robot. We decided that Baxter robot, known familiarly as DE-NIRO (Design Engineering Natural Interaction RObot),  would be the best choice as our desired task required a large workspace that the Panda robot could not reach and because DE-NIRO has two arms enabling  the sequence to be completed faster. Risk minimisation was also implemented to add robustness. This enabled DE-NIRO to place the bricks from the inside out with a delay between the arms to avoid collision.

To break the project into a more manageable and organised structure, the different elements of the code were connected as such:
