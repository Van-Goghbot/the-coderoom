Arm Master Package
========================


Arm Master is the *ROS Package* which controls the arm. At the most basic level, its purpose is to query goal
end effector poses, and interpolate their from the arms current position.

Code for this computation is located in python scripts. Many of which are exposes them selves as ROS node, but also some that simply
provide function calls.

File Structure
-----------------
The core of the package files are structure as follows::

    arm_master
    ├── docs
    └── launch
        ├── light.launch
        ├── panda_one_brick.launch
        └── sim.launch
    └── scripts
        ├── arm_master_main.py
        ├── arm_master_functions.py
        ├── move_arm_server.py
        ├── arm_server_functions.py
        ├── arm_utils.py
        └── dropped_checker_server.launch
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── package.xml

Launch files `light.launch`_, `panda_one_brick.launch`_, `sim.launch`_ run all nessecary ros nodes.
Refer to *launch* for more information on running the code

The *scripts* are structured such that there is a script which defines the ROS related code, and a script which provides ROS free functions. To illustrate observe the difference between
``arm_master_main.py`` and ``arm_master_functions.py``

Once running, the panda arm loops through a control sequence defined in `arm_master_main.py`_,
which calls services and publishes to topics defined in ``move_arm_server.py``

I will explain this control squence in the remainder of this section by going line by line
through arm master main and explaining the neseecary conecepts required to understand what is going on


Real Panda
-----------------------------------

At the start of the runnable code, a variable ``real_panda`` is defined. It is essential this is set correctly
depending on wether you wish to run the code on gazebo or on the real franka panda.


Setting this variable to ``False``, ensures that the code doesn't wait for services from the real robot which will
not apear on the ROS network

.. warning::
   The ``real_panda`` variable also needs to be set in `move_arm_server.py`_

.. warning::
   If you find that the code is not running and is getting hanged up at launch time it could be beacuse the arm_master_main
   is waiting for all the required nodes to be launched. Double check ``real_panda`` is correct.
   Note that the code calls ``rospy.wait_for_service()`` each time it is required to connect to another service
   or action client
   service or action client.

   .. literalinclude:: ../scripts/arm_master_main.py
      :lines: 50-69


Loop
-----------------------------------
The main loop has the following structure::

  #Continue to loop until you have placed the correct number of bricks
  while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        if placed < num_bricks:

            #Query Positions
            brick = get_brick_pos()
            goal = get_goal_pos()

            #Move towards brick and pick up
            pick_up(brick)

            #Move from pick up positon to place down position
            move_towards(brick, goal)

            #Place down brick
            place_down(goal)

            # Increment num of brick placed
            placed += 1


If you wish to change how the arm moves, change the order in which the ``pick_up()``, ``place_down()``, ``place_down()``
functions are called. Additional motion functions also available in ``arm_master_main.py`` are ``go_to()`` and ``move_arm_curve()``. To illustrate, The main loop for our project implementation was implemented as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../scripts/arm_master_main.py
  :lines: 50-69



Here is more detailed information for the specific motion functions. Vist the :doc:`../api_reference.rst` API Reference section of the documentation for more information

arm_master is a ros package which provides the nessecary control flow functions for controlling the panada arm.
Let me see how this deals with spaces. I am interested
