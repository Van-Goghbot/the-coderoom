+ finish documenting source code 15
+ write up 30
+ get it all on read the docs 15

y detailed documentation,
describing all theoretic and
implementation aspects of the
project. Includes not only
explanations about the successful
achievements, but also about the
failed attempts during the project
(i.e. what worked and what didnâ€™t
work).





+ make graphics for pages
+ format
+running on gazebo
+ talk about the namespace issue with rqt_graph
+ film video
+ friction set up



Go through and format code and publish/push - Do this so I set up the team who will be getting up soon.



more content (1hr)
rest (1hr)
run()
Add dropped checked to documentation


+ go through and format all pages and add photos ect.... of going through the process and off your own screen



OVER ALL PLAN:

- Film setup with Gazebo all the way throug
- Finish up and content what is existing (run on real robot and arm amster main)

- Write part about testing on Gazebo

- Get team mates to write comments on code
- Check links on front page
- share github with team mates and get them to proof read each one and then push back










+ IN SCHOOL TOMMROW GET MOST RECENT PANDA MOVE IT CONFIG AND PUSH IT TO YOUR CODE




- Edited documentation
- Video on running code
- Getting Code working on gazebo
- Automated API calls in documentation
